    p Thank you for scheduling your session with me. I am looking forward to our session on #{timeDate}.
    p   If something comes up and the scheduled time will not work, let me know a minimum of 6 hours before the appointment time and we’ll figure something out.
    |
    p   This session will take place here: #{link}
    |
    p   (If you have not used zoom before please join the meeting at least 15 minutes early because it may have you download and install some software.)
    |
    p   Again, all I need from you:
    ul
      li   Be on Tutors & Students Slack 5 minutes before your time slot.

      li   Make sure your computer/mic/internet connection are working.

      li   Make sure your workspace is quiet and free from interruptions.

      li   At the end of the session, I will provide you with a link to a 2 minute evaluation form that you are required to complete.

    |
    p   Slack or email me with any questions.  I’m looking forward to our meeting!


    p   Please Reply All to this email so that I know you have seen it.
